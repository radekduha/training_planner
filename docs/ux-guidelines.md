# UX guidelines

## Primary flow
New training -> pick trainer -> mark status.
Every screen should support that flow with minimal clicks.

## Principles
- One screen per task. Avoid modal chains.
- Clear status labels and visible next step.
- Show "why recommended" for each trainer.
- Prefer defaults over optional fields.
- Empty states must explain what to do next.

## List views
- Training list is the main screen.
- Provide quick filters: date, status, training type, "no trainer".
- Use readable, large touch targets for mobile.

## Forms
- Short labels and inline hints.
- Validate on save with clear error text.
- Keep address as free text; handle geocoding errors gracefully.
